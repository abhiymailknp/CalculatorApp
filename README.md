# CalculatorApp

Build this project in order to understand the flow of Angular Application and learn about the components in Angular.


## Challenges

This was the first time I was working with angular so faced quiet common syntax mistakes , debugged and corrected them.
Also the part where we have to perform operations on already performed calculation was a little challenging . 
So I will suggest anyone who is starting with a webframework or full stack application using Angular or React should try to built a small app so that they understand basic syntax.





This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
